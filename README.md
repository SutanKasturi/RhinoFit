#Fifth Milstone:
- Update benchmark - when I click on update, there's no way to insert a colon for the time
- iPhone 5C - "TRACK WOD" is over run with text, see screen shot. Let's put it on a new line under "You have attended this class" so it doesn't interfere. 
- If there are no wall posts - it says "There are no walls" - please change this to "There are no wall posts at this time, post one today!". 
- iPhone 5C - "Post a Wall Message" - The screen starts at the bottom where the button is, and I can't scroll up to the top of the page. 
- Please remove the auto-correct from the email field on the login screen. 
- What's your IP address? I will add you to the list of verified IPs so I can get you to log in as dropboxcrossfit@gmail.com. Once you log in as this address the app crashes.
